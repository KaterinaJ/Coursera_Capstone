The ploblem I choose is how to choose a good restaurant and a place for fun for a student in University of Toronto to spend weekend time. It is because I am a university student now that this problem is highly correlated with my daily life, so solving this problems may be realistic to the sutdents like me. Moreover, as we clustered Toronto in previous weeks, I took university of Toronto as an example."

The data should be cleaned and modified and then construct a dataframe to analyze the problem."
